# AdvancedKotlinFlows

An implementation of a partial todo list using advice from Adam McNeilly's TOA stream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGjcE4JQ-cc">TOA (#28): Filtering Tasks By Completed Status</a>

I learned a ton from watching Adam, Gabor, cpaleop, and others debate how and where to put things...
Reactivity, flows, states, repository patterns and alternatives, etc; 

## Concepts 

  * Kotlin
  * Compose UI
  * Room
  * Flows - map, flatMap, combine, distinctUntilChanged, stateIn
